      <section id="aboutme">
        <p>I’m a very sarcastic person who laughs at her own jokes (sometimes even 20 minutes after telling them), a person who waves at a dog but not its owner when walking, and a person who will stay up until two in the morning because “there’s always time for one more episode.” I am obsessed with crime shows, documentaries, and almost all things related to serial killers or murder. Don’t be scared — it’s just because my other major is psychology and I am fascinated by the human mind.
        <br><br>
        I am a traveler, an adventurer, and a constant explorer of everything life has to offer.  I don’t take no for an answer and constantly push myself into new situations because I believe the best way to learn is through experience. I have a strong love for the Oxford comma and put anyone who doesn’t use it in the same category as chocolate haters. I am fearless and willing to try anything once. I am funny (or at least I think so) and my sense of humor consists mostly of memes, dad jokes, and cringe-worthy puns.
        <br><br>
        Having moved seven times in my 21 years of life, three of which have been international, I have an appreciation for new perspectives and value adaptability and flexibility, both in team members and work. I try to combine my passion for understanding human behavior with my drive to craft work that will connect with people to create copy that will make people laugh, smile, and think deeper.</p>
