      <h3>About Me </h3>
        <p>I'm a very sarcastic person who laughs at her own jokes (sometimes even 20 minutes after telling them), a person who waves at a dog but not its owner when walking, and a person who will stay up until two in the morning because "there's always time for one more episode." I am obsessed with crime shows, documentaries, and almost all things related to serial killers or murder. Don't be scared - it's just because my other major is psychology and I am fascinated by the human mind. </p>
