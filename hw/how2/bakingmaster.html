        <h2>Let's Get 1 Thing Straight</h2>
        <p>If you're here, its because you don't know how to bake for shit and you want to learn. I'm going to start off simple, because if you can't even get this, then boy are you in trouble. Maybe you want to be a cool parent who bakes for their kid's school. You could be someone who wants to be a good friend or coworker and wants to bake for a someone's birthday. Who knows, you might be like me- a fatass college student who enjoys baked goods but is either too lazy or cheap to make it from scratch. Whoever you are, you are in the right place.</p>
